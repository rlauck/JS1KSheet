JS1KSheet
=========

A feature packed spreadsheet in 1024 bytes of javascript+html

* Vanilla Javascript
* Formulas start with "="
* Reference other cells "=A1+b2" (case-insensitive)
* Aggregate and Math functions included sum, avg, min, max, pow, sin, cos... (case-sensitive)
* Range references: "=sum(A1:C30)"
* Enter key support!!! (case-sensitive)
* Unlimited rows. Hit Enter in the last row to add more until your browser begs for mercy!
* 100 Columns should be enough for anybody
* localStorage persistence
* Now in color!
* Works on some non-sucky browsers (ECMAScript 5 - tested on Firefox 25 and Chrome 30)

Disclaimer: It should go without saying but this is code golf and should not be used as an example of best, fast or secure practices - don't copy and paste it into your production code or homework.
